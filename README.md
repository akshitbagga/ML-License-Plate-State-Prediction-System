# ML-Plant-Based-Disease-Prediction-System
We all have seen cameras on expressways which identify license plates and then deduct the amount as per the state plates, the expressway your vehicle is moving on. All this happens when the correct license plate is detected by the cameras. While it is not possible to take a picture of all the license plates and insert them in the databases, these work on a machine learning model which has been trained on some license plates, which detects patterns and numbers/alphabets from license plates. I have tried to replicate a machine learning model which trains on an existing license plate dataset and then tests on license plates, generating a confidence score for the prediction. I have used Tensorflow library to train the ML model and written python code in Jupyter Lab.
